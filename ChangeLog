jarbes ChangeLog

Version 1.7.0 -- June 2018
  * Implementation of the function "hmr" for combining aggregated data and 
  individual participant data. 
  * New dataset "healing": this dataset corresponds to a systematic review of
  aggregated data. The primary endpoint is healing without amputation in one 
  year follow up.
  * New dataset "healingipd": This dataset corresponds to individual participant
  data for diabetic patients.

Version 1.1.0		-- December 2017
  * Implementation of the "ges" function for Generalized Evidence Synthesis.
  * Implementation of Half Cauchy priors for components of variances.
  * Implementation of Empirical Bias adjustement for Observational Studies.
  * Implementation of Penalization methods for Observationa Studies.
  * First prototype of the "hmr" function for combining IPD and AD data.

Version 1.0.0		-- September 2017
  * Implementation of the "metarisk"" function for bivariate hierarchical
    meta-regression of aggregated data.
  * Documentation improved. 

Version 0.5.0 -- January 2017
  * Creation of data examples:
  * ppv.cap: PPV23 (23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) with 16 Randomized
    Clinical Trials (RCTs); outcome variable CAP (community-acquired pneumonia).
    
  * ppv.ipde: PPV23 with 3 RCTs and observational studies (5 cohorts and 3 case
    controls); all data types are aggregated results; outcome variable IPD 
    (invasive pneumococcal disease). 
    
  * stem.cells: 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of two treatment groups of 
    heart disease patients, where the treatment group received bone marrow stem 
    cells and the control group a placebo treatment.
    
  * opti: one pragmatic trial, the OPTIMIZE trial, which evaluates the clinical  
    effectiveness of a perioperative, cardiac outputâ€“guided hemodynamic therapy
    algorithm. 
    And 21 small RCTs with evaluation of Risk of Bias. All are studies have 
    aggregated data.
  
  * foot.ad: 36 RCTs which investigate adjunctive therapies vs. routine medical care in
    diabetic patients. The primary outcome is healing without foot amputation. There
    are aggregated covariates describing studies and patients characteristics. 
    
  * foot.ipd: A cohort study with 260 diabetic patients, the outcome variable is 
    healing without amputation in a followup of one year. In addition we have 14
    potential risk factors.
