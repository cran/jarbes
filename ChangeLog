jarbes ChangeLog

Version 2.2.2 -- September-October 2024 ............................................

Improvements of the bcmixmeta() function to collect information about co-clustering
for studies in the bias cluster.

Experimental:
- bcmixmeta() function with two directions of bias
- bcmixmeta() function with one covariate in meta-regression
- dpmetareg() function to perform Dependent Dirichlet Process meta-regression.


Version 2.2.1 -- June 2024 .................................................

  Correction of two bugs:

    1) bcmeta() function, the biased mean is mu[2] <- B =< mu.bias = mu[1]+B
    2) bcmixmeta() function, the biased means of the DP for the betas[i] is
       mu.k[k] ~ dnorm(B, inv.var.beta)

Version 2.2.0 -- November 2023 .............................................

  Implementation of the bcmixmeta for the ISCB-2023 paper

  Implementation of the bcdpmeta for the ISCB-2023 paper

Version 2.1.2 -- August 2023 ...................................................

* dpmeta: Bayesian meta-analysis with Dirichlet Process with
           base distribution G0=N(mu.0, sigma.0^2)

* dpmmeta: Bayesian meta-analysis with Dirichlet Process Mixture with
           base distribution G0=N(mu.0, sigma.0^2)

* bcdpmeta: Bias Corrected model with Dirichlet Process.
            I try three different possibilities:
            1) Using dnormmix in JAGS, which is extremely slow
            2) Using common w_k and alpha
            3) Using two different DPs, one for theta and one for beta.
               This is a convex combination of two DP.

Version 2.1.1 -- February 2023..................................................

* jarbes does not depend of the tidyverse anymore.
Only tidyr is imported.

Version 2.1.0 -- May-June-July-August 2022..................................................

* New data set: hips

* Vignette for hmr() with a real example.

* Important Bug correction in hmr(): From version 1.7.0 (Verde, 2019) to 1.7.4
  I commented a line in the preparation of the IPD. This action generated a massive
  differences in the estimation of mu.phi. Now, this bug is solved.

* New function: effect() for the class "hmr"". This function plots the posterior
                contour for effectivenes in a subgroup identify by the hmr.

* The function plot.hmr() only shows the location of the baseline risk corresponding
               to AD and IPD.

* Parameters: beta.0 and beta.1 are now
              alpha.0 and alpha.1. This is for consistency in the notation in the
              current presentation of the model.
              This change affect the Figures of the supplementary material of Verde (2019).

* Bug correction: Odds ratio calculation with different link functions in metarisk()
* Bug correction: Odds ratio calculation with different link functions in hmr()

* Predictive summaries are depreciated in hmr()
* Predictive summaries are depreciated in metarisk()
* summary.hmr: predictive summaries omitted.
* summary.metarisk: predictive summaries omitted.

* The argument to run rjags is depreciated in all functions.
